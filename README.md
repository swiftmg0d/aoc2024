# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! 🎄✨

## About


Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, and participants from around the world work to solve them. This repository contains my solutions in TypeScript.
